    Assignment #2
    =============

    
    -------------
    Java Version
    -------------

    (This is the version running on tux) 1.8.0_91-b14

      -------------
      Running It
      -------------

      

	-------------
	What Works
	-------------

	All specified textboxes and functionality. I pained through more than 12 hours doing this assignment.

	Validation should be working, buttons are disabled and enabled accordingly depending on filled items.

	The "Add" button is just a buttongroup since it would be ugly as a Add button with 3 radio buttons coming out after clicked. A "Save button has been created to save the new item.

	  -------------
	  What doesn't
	  -------------
	  Backspace/deletion in textboxes does not update correctly in the summary label
	  There may be bugs in validation checking.
	  Actual valid date checking and time checking
	  Price textfields are not formatted

	    -------------
	    NOTES
	    -------------
	    
	    I hope the hours spent working on this assignment was worth it.
